# AlphaFBase

## General Description
Our website is dedicated to managing different administrative parts of a football club, especially to clubs from the lower leagues of Romania, but can also be used for amateur teams (“Sunday League”) or even minifootball teams. These administrative parts can range from details about the players and the staff, to economic details.

At first, the site has a page which contains information about what we are offering, and a list with the clubs that are already using our service. Then, if the club owner is interested, by making a payment which will represent a monthly fee, can register through a representative that will manage the club through our site.

Once registered, the admin has the option to add different details about the club (name, when it was founded etc), then about the squad (age, position, goals scored, assists, injured or not etc), and then about the staff (age, role etc). He can also register details about the wages of players and staff. Then, of course, there will be a page where all the data stored will be available to see and analyze.

As additional features, on the main page that is seen by a normal user clicking on the website, all the clubs that are using our service will have a link that takes the user to a “template website” about that specific team, with certain details that will be shown, and others which will be hidden (like wages or tactics).

The admin can also post job listings, that specify what  they are looking for (players in a certain position, or staff members), and the users will see a page which shows them these listings, and then can apply for them.
